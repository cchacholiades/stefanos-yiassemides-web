            &ldquo;Stefanos is a fantastic composer to work with on projects. He is an extremely reliable, versatile and creative artist who responds very well to our musical briefs and feedback. He is a very versatile composer who can work effectively across our varied musical requirements from epic orchestral scores to melodic pop/rock songs&rdquo;

            &ldquo;From the outset Stefanos worked hard to accommodate a constantly shifting design ethos, adapting to rough briefs with a creativity that enhanced the projects narrative elements. With each track he brought a distinct tone and emotional drive that underpinned the core themes of the narrative events they framed, and when change was needed he worked hard to accommodate the needs of the game with a friendly and easy to approach manner. If you need distinct, emotionally driven music, then there are few composers I could reccomend more.&rdquo;
