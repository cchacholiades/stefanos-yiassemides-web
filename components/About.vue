                    Born and raised in the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, I am a Greek/Cypriot music composer currently based in Bristol, UK. At the age of 13 I picked my first instrument and started studying and practicing the art of music. Since then, playing and writing music has been my lifelong passion. To date, I have produced music in a vast variety of styles. Growing up as part of a family full of cinephiles, I always believed that the marriage between music and the visuals is one of the most beautiful kind of art that exists, thus pursuing a career as a film composer felt like the natural thing to do.

                    During my time in Cyprus, I studied under some of the most acclaimed musicians in the Island. I then continued my music studies abroad earning a Bachelor of Arts with Honors in Professional Musicianship from the British and Irish Institute of Modern Music (University of Sussex) and a Master of Arts in Music Composition for Film &amp; TV from the University of Bristol.
